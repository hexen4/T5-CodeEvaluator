# T5 Fine-Tuning with QLoRA

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and resources for fine-tuning the Google T5 Mini model. Due to the limitations of the NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU, QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) is used to make the fine-tuning process more memory-efficient while maintaining performance.

## Motivation

The RTX 2070 GPU, with its 8 GB memory, poses challenges for traditional fine-tuning methods, especially with models like T5. QLoRA offers a solution by reducing the memory requirements, enabling effective fine-tuning on limited hardware.

## Structure

- **`EDA.ipynb`**: Notebook for exploratory data analysis, providing insights into the dataset before fine-tuning.
  
- **`benchmark.py`**: Script to benchmark the fine-tuned model and evaluate performance improvements.

- **`dataimport.py`**: Handles data import and preprocessing, preparing it for training.

- **`fine-tune.py`**: Script for fine-tuning the T5 Mini model using QLoRA, optimized for the RTX 2070 GPU.

## Fine-Tuning Approach

### Why QLoRA?

Given the memory limitations of the RTX 2070, QLoRA is employed to reduce the memory footprint of the fine-tuning process without compromising on model accuracy.

### Steps

1. **Model Selection**: Starting with the T5 Mini model for its balance of performance and efficiency.
2. **Data Preparation**: Data is cleaned and preprocessed with `dataimport.py`.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: The model is fine-tuned using `fine-tune.py`, utilizing QLoRA for efficiency.
4. **Benchmarking**: Performance is evaluated with `benchmark.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU or similar

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare data with `dataimport.py`.
2. Fine-tune the model using `fine-tune.py`.
3. Benchmark the results with `benchmark.py`.

## Results

Performance metrics and results from the fine-tuning process will be documented here.
